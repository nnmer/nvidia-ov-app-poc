# Shared Extensions

The repository contains a few extensions that are shared amongst the sample applications that we showcase.

## Setup Extension: `msft.khi.viewer.setup`

It is standard practice when building applications to have a setup extension that enables you to set up the layout of the relevant windows and configure the menu and various things that happen on startup.

Look at the documentation for **msft.khi.viewer.setup** to see more details. Its code is also deeply documented so you can review what each part is doing.

## Window Extension: `msft.khi.viewer.window`

This example extension creates a window for your application.
The Window content itself is just for demonstration purposes and doesn't do anything but it is used in the various applications to show how it can be added to a collection of other Extensions coming from Kit or Code.

Similar to the setup extension, check the window extension's included documentation and review the code for more details
